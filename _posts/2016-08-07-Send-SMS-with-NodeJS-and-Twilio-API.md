Now you can go to the page [Get Started with SMS](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/basics) and to practice.

> If before sending SMS you will get a [Error - 21408](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/21408) "Permission to send an SMS has not been enabled for the region indicated by the 'To' number". Just click on the following link [https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international/sms](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international/sms) and apply the appropriate for you Geographic Permissions

Once you have finished with the Get Started with SMS and [got your phone number](https://i.imgur.com/gf0Ujid.png), You can go to the console where you will get your Twilio Credentials [https://www.twilio.com/console](https://www.twilio.com/console)

![TWILIO_CREDENTIALS](https://i.imgur.com/2mTgSWJ.png)

Now you can use your credentials in the following code replacing the corresponding values as you want

`server.js`

{% highlight js %}
// Twilio Credentials 
var accountSid = 'accountSid';
var authToken = 'authToken';

// Require the Twilio module and create a REST client
var client = require('twilio')(accountSid, authToken);

client.messages.create({
	to: 'ToNumber', // You can only send messages to verified numbers in trial
	from: 'FromNumber', // https://i.imgur.com/gf0Ujid.png
	body: 'Text'
}, function(err, message) {
	console.log(message.sid);
});
{% endhighlight %}

install [twilio package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twilio) with `npm install twilio` and run this code with `node server.js`
